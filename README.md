# COVID-19-Data-Tracker
# 📘 COVID-19 Data Analysis
This project presents an analysis of the global COVID-19 pandemic using Python. The notebook explores key trends, patterns, and insights from publicly available COVID-19 data, focusing on confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries over time and across countries.

# 🎯 Project Objectives
- To analyze the spread and impact of COVID-19 globally.

- To visualize trends in confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries.

- To identify countries most affected and evaluate their trajectories.

- To provide a foundation for further exploration or forecasting.

# 🧰 Tools and Libraries Used
- Python 3

- Jupyter Notebook

- NumPy – Numerical operations

- Pandas – Data manipulation and analysis

- Matplotlib – Static plotting

- Seaborn – Statistical data visualization

# ▶️ How to Run/View the Project
- **Clone this Repository** 
 <a src="git clone https://github.com/fiona12-code/COVID19-Data-Tracker.git">Clone repo </a>
- **Install Required Libraries**
- pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn jupyter
- **Launch Jupyter Notebook**
- jupyter notebook
- cd COVID19.ipynb and run all cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.

# 📈 Analysis Highlights
- **Countries of Interest:** Kenya, India, Afghanistan, Uganda, Zimbabwe, USA.

- **Data Cleaning:** Missing values were identified and handled. Dates were converted to datetime objects for proper plotting.

- **Visualizations:**

1. **Total Cases Over Time:** Plotted cumulative case counts for Kenya, India, and Afghanistan.

2. **Total Deaths Over Time:** Compared fatality trends across countries.

3. **Daily New Cases:** Illustrated fluctuations in daily infections per country.

4. **Death Rate Estimation:** A crude death rate was calculated.

# 🔍 Insights and Reflections
- The number of confirmed cases increased exponentially during the early months of the pandemic.

- Certain countries (like the USA, India, and Brazil) experienced significantly higher case loads and death counts.

- Visualization helped reveal regional peaks and trends that may not be obvious from raw data alone.

- The importance of data cleaning and validation became apparent during analysis due to inconsistencies and missing entries in some datasets.
