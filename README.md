# COVID-19-Data-Tracker
# 📘 COVID-19 Data Analysis
This project presents an analysis of the global COVID-19 pandemic using Python. The notebook explores key trends, patterns, and insights from publicly available COVID-19 data, focusing on confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries over time and across countries.

#🎯 Project Objectives
- To analyze the spread and impact of COVID-19 globally.

- To visualize trends in confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries.

- To identify countries most affected and evaluate their trajectories.

- To provide a foundation for further exploration or forecasting.

# 🧰 Tools and Libraries Used
- Python 3

- Jupyter Notebook

- NumPy – Numerical operations

- Pandas – Data manipulation and analysis

- Matplotlib – Static plotting

- Seaborn – Statistical data visualization

🔍 Insights and Reflections
The number of confirmed cases increased exponentially during the early months of the pandemic.

Certain countries (like the USA, India, and Brazil) experienced significantly higher case loads and death counts.

Visualization helped reveal regional peaks and trends that may not be obvious from raw data alone.

The importance of data cleaning and validation became apparent during analysis due to inconsistencies and missing entries in some datasets.

Let me know if you'd like me to tailor the README based on specific plots, data sources, or analysis methods found inside the notebook—I can extract them for a more personalized document.
